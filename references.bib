@article{DAUM2022103353,
abstract = {CONTEXT
There are high hopes that digital tools can reduce constraints to livestock development, which in turn promises to alleviate poverty, improve food and nutrition security, and reduce environmental footprints. Yet, little systematic evidence exists on the state of digital livestock in low- and middle-income-countries. Thus, it remains unclear whether such high hopes are justified.
OBJECTIVE
Focusing on India and Kenya, we aim to better understand, among others, the degree of technological sophistication of the digital tools used, the types of value chains and constraints addressed, the types of business models pursued, and more broadly the opportunities and challenges of digital tools for agricultural development.
METHOD
We combine a review of digital tools in India and Kenya with three “on-the-ground” case studies: Herdman, a tool for Indian dairy organizations working with small-scale livestock keepers, facilitating data collection and supervision of field agents; Farmtree, a tool supporting medium-scale livestock keepers in India to manage their herds, and iCow, an e-extension tool for farmers in Kenya. For the review, we develop a conceptual framework that distinguishes different types of tools: 1) “simple digital tools”, providing generic information, 2) “smart digital tools”, providing tailored information based on data entered by livestock keepers, 3) “smart digital tools”, using data from sensors, 4) “digital tools for value chains”, enabling the integration of value chain actors, 5) “automated digital systems”, which are coupled with robots, allowing for automation.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Digital tools provide many new options to address constraints to livestock development. So far, most tools are “simple digital tools”, followed by “smart digital tools” using manual data and tools for value chains. Such tools that only require smartphone ownership are the “sweet spot” for supporting digital livestock development; however, even embodied “smart digital tools” using sensors can be of relevance for small-scale livestock keepers with appropriate organizational models. Most digital tools focus on dairy production, suggesting neglect of other types of livestock, and there are few tools for pastoralists.
SIGNIFICANCE
The conceptual framework as well as many of the lessons learned are of relevance to understanding the contribution of digital tools to livestock development - and agricultural development more broadly - in low- and middle-income-countries. While digital tools are no silver bullets – and come with some new challenges such as data security and sovereignty concerns - they are likely to become a key pillar of agricultural and livestock development in the near future.},

@article{Riaboff2022,
abstract = {Precision Technologies are emerging in the context of livestock farming to improve management practices and the health and welfare of livestock through monitoring individual animal behaviour. Continuously collecting information about livestock behaviour is a promising way to address several of these target areas. Wearable accelerometer sensors are currently the most promising system to capture livestock behaviour. Accelerometer data should be analysed properly to obtain reliable information on livestock behaviour. Many studies are emerging on this subject, but none to date has highlighted which techniques to recommend or avoid. In this paper, we systematically review the literature on the prediction of livestock behaviour from raw accelerometer data, with a specific focus on livestock ruminants. Our review is based on 66 surveyed articles, providing reliable evidence of a 3-step methodology common to all studies, namely (1) Data Collection, (2) Data Pre-Processing and (3) Model Development, with different techniques used at each of the 3 steps. The aim of this review is thus to (i) summarise the predictive performance of models and point out the main limitations of the 3-step methodology, (ii) make recommendations on a methodological blueprint for future studies and (iii) propose lines to explore in order to address the limitations outlined. This review shows that the 3-step methodology ensures that several major ruminant behaviours can be reliably predicted, such as grazing/eating, ruminating, moving, lying or standing. However, the areas faces two main limitations: (i) Most models are less accurate on rarely observed or transitional behaviours, behaviours may be important for assessing health, welfare and environmental issues and (ii) many models exhibit poor generalisation, that can compromise their commercial use. To overcome these limitations we recommend maximising variability in the data collected, selecting pre-processing methods that are appropriate to target behaviours being studied, and using classifiers that avoid over-fitting to improve generalisability. This review presents the current situation involving the use of sensors as valuable tools in the field of behaviour recording and contributes to the improvement of existing tools for automatically monitoring ruminant behaviour in order to address some of the issues faced by livestock farming.},

abstract = {Calf behaviors such as step activity, lying bouts, and lying time may be an indicator of calf health and welfare. To reduce time-consuming visual observations, the use of behavioral monitoring systems have been developed to capture these data. Previous studies have validated lying behaviors using an accelerometer (HPG; HOBO Pendant G data logger, Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA) in calves. However, the HPG does not measure step activity. The objectives of this study were to (1) validate step activity, lying bouts, and lying time of AfiTag II (AT2; AfiTag II, Afimilk Ltd., Kibbutz Afikim, Israel) to observations from video, and (2) to compare the behavioral data from AT2 to the HPG. Calves (n = 5) were group housed with an automatic calf feeder. Video cameras were installed at both sides of the pen, and observations were analyzed for 7 h/calf. The AT2 and the HPG were both attached to the lateral side of the right rear leg of 5 calves, and data were recorded for 10 d. The full 10-d data set was used to examine correlations for lying bouts and lying time between AT2 and the HPG. The HPG was set at a 60-s sampling interval and the output was analyzed both unfiltered as well as utilizing a 1-min event filter to remove potentially erroneous readings. The AT2 recorded step activity, lying bouts, and lying time, and summarized these behaviors in 15-min periods. The AT2 recorded lying time in 3-min intervals, which were then automatically summarized in 15-min periods. The correlations of step activity, lying bouts, and lying time between video recordings and AT2 were 0.99. For the second objective, correlations between AT2 and the HPG were 0.99 for lying time and 0.93 for lying bouts. The 1-min event filter resulted in a 0.03 improvement in correlations for lying bouts between the HPG and AT2. The high correlation between video recordings and AT2 suggest that this device can be used to measure step activity, lying time, and lying bouts in unweaned dairy calves housed in groups.},

The aim of this paper is to give readers a comprehensive view of current applications and new possibilities, but also explain the limitations and challenges of this technology. RFID has been used for years in animal identification and tracking, being a common practice in many farms. Also it has been used in the food chain for traceability control. The implementation of sensors in tags, make possible to monitor the cold chain of perishable food products and the development of new applications in fields like environmental monitoring, irrigation, specialty crops and farm machinery. However, it is not all advantages. There are also challenges and limitations that should be faced in the next years. The operation in harsh environments, with dirt, extreme temperatures; the huge volume of data that are difficult to manage; the need of longer reading ranges, due to the reduction of signal strength due to propagation in crop canopy; the behavior of the different frequencies, understanding what is the right one for each application; the diversity of the standards and the level of granularity are some of them.},
