\begin{abstract}
A great challenge of today's humanity is to serve the intensively
increasing demand for food, in an environmentally friendly manner.
A promising way to address this problem is precision agriculture,
based on extensive monitoring. In our research we focus on dairy
cattle and rumen bolus sensors. This paper presents the preliminary
results of an experimental bolus, equipped with accelerometer,
shock sensor and temperature meter.

\section{Measurement setup}

\subsection{Bolus sensor}

Design of the bolus is constrained by several factors. As these type
of devices are getting more and more standard, special applicators are
exist to inject them into the rumen. The physical dimensions are therefore
limited by the applicator. The desired form factor is a cylinder with
diameter of 40 mm and length of 140 mm.

The material of the bolus should resist the environment inside the rumen,
i.e. the moisture, temperature, motion and pH. The cover should protect
the sensitive electronics inside sensor. The POM-C technical plastic was
chosen as the material, which can be easily machined on a lathe and provides
the required strength and sealing.

A more or less fixed orientation of the bolus would ease the signal
processing of the accelerometer. To provide some defined orientation
in at least one axis the weight distribution of the bolus is designed
to be asymmetrical, the battery being one one end and a low density
material on the other side. The electronics are placed in between these two.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{The physical layout of the bolus.}
\label{bolus-physical-layout}
\end{figure}

The physical layout of the bolus is shown in Fig. \ref{bolus-physical-layout}.
The power source of the unit is a non-rechargeable D type Lithium battery,
which provides 3.7 V and 18 Ah capacity and most of the mass. The
microcontroller on the circuit board is a TODO, which controls the
sensors and the radio.

The accelerometer is a TODO, which has TODO bit resolution on 3 axes and
set to TODO Hz sample rate. This gives a good balance between the available
bandwidth and the data processing possibilities. This modality is extended
with an additional shock detector. This sensor acts as a simple contact switch,
which activates when an abrupt motion event happens. The microcontroller
counts the number of detections in every second.

The third sensor is a digital temperature meter (TODO type), which gives
a precision of TODO \textcelsius.

Since the body of the cattle gives significant attenuation of RF signals
the radio chip, the communication frequency and modulation was chosen very
carefully. The body of the animals tends to give more attenuation on higher
frequencies (especially 2.4 GHz seems to be a bad decesion), but on the
other hand lower frequencies require larger antennas to the same gain.
Another compromise is present between the data bandwidth and the link budget.
In this design the TODO digital radio was chosen. It operates in the 169 MHz
band and has a raw bandwith of TODO kbps. In this frequency a
$\lambda / 4 \approx 42 cm$ would be ideal, which clearly cannot be fit
inside the bolus, therefore a much smaller, approx. 6 cm wire antenna
was used.

\section{Summary}

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
